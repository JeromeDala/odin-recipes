    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../lasagna-pic.jpg">
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe features layers of tender pasta, rich meat sauce, and a creamy cheese filling, all baked to perfection for a truly satisfying meal.
        
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a rich combination of fillings. The base usually starts with a hearty meat sauce, made by simmering ground beef or pork with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs like basil and oregano, creating a savory and flavorful ragu. The sauce is complemented by a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, often seasoned with nutmeg and parsley for added depth. To assemble the lasagna, cooked pasta sheets are laid out in a baking dish, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, then a layer of cheese mixture, and sometimes a sprinkling of mozzarella for extra cheesiness. This process is repeated in layers until the dish is stacked high.

        After layering, the lasagna is baked in the oven until bubbly and golden, with the cheese on top becoming slightly crispy. The result is a comforting, satisfying meal with a perfect balance of textures—from the tender pasta and juicy meat to the creamy cheese and savory sauce. Whether served on its own or with a side salad and garlic bread, lasagna is always a crowd-pleaser and makes for great leftovers, as the flavors only improve over time.</p>
