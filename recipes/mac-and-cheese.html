    <h1>Mac and Cheese Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../mac-and-cheese.jpg">
    <p>Mac and Cheese is a classic comfort food loved by many for its creamy, cheesy goodness and satisfying texture. Typically made with elbow macaroni or any pasta shape of choice, the dish is combined with a rich, velvety cheese sauce made from butter, milk, and a blend of cheeses, often including cheddar, mozzarella, or a mix of both. The creamy sauce envelops the tender pasta, creating a dish that’s both hearty and indulgent. Often baked with a crunchy breadcrumb topping or served stovetop for a quicker version, mac and cheese is versatile and can be enhanced with extras like crispy bacon, caramelized onions, or even a sprinkle of spices like paprika for extra flavor. Perfect as a main dish or a side, it’s a beloved comfort food that’s always a crowd-pleaser.

    Start by cooking the pasta according to the package instructions, then drain and set it aside. While the pasta cooks, prepare the cheese sauce. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat, then whisk in flour to create a roux. Cook for a minute or two until the mixture thickens, and then gradually add milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Once the milk is fully incorporated, bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing it to thicken further. Stir in the cheese, a handful at a time, until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of mustard powder or garlic powder for added flavor.

    Once the cheese sauce is ready, combine it with the cooked pasta, making sure all the noodles are coated in the rich sauce. For extra richness, you can fold in some extra cheese and give it a good stir. If you prefer a baked version, transfer the cheesy pasta mixture to a baking dish, top with breadcrumbs and a bit of butter, then bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 20-25 minutes until golden and bubbling. Whether stovetop or baked, mac and cheese is a comforting, creamy dish that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with a variety of sides like roasted vegetables, fried chicken, or a simple salad.
