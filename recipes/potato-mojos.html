    <h1>Potato Mojos Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../potato-mojos-pic.jpg">
    <p><strong>Potato Mojos</strong> are a popular, flavorful snack made from crispy, seasoned potato wedges. Typically enjoyed as a side dish or appetizer, they are golden-brown, crunchy on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. The potatoes are usually cut into wedges, coated with a blend of spices like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and herbs, then baked or fried until crispy. Often served with a tangy dipping sauce, such as ranch or a spicy ketchup, Potato Mojos make for a perfect treat for parties, movie nights, or any casual gathering. Their savory, zesty flavor and satisfying texture are sure to please any crowd.

        To prepare, start by washing and slicing potatoes into wedges, ensuring they are of even size to cook uniformly. Then, toss the wedges in a mixture of olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and a bit of dried oregano or thyme for extra flavor. The oil helps the spices adhere to the potatoes and gives them a golden, crispy exterior once cooked.

        Next, spread the seasoned wedges on a baking sheet in a single layer, ensuring they aren’t overcrowded for maximum crispiness. Bake at a high temperature (around 425°F or 220°C) for 30-40 minutes, flipping the wedges halfway through to ensure they cook evenly. Alternatively, you can fry the mojos in hot oil for a quicker and extra-crispy texture. Once golden brown and crispy, serve with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch, ketchup, or spicy aioli. These homemade Potato Mojos are a crowd-pleaser, perfect for serving as a side dish or a satisfying snack!
